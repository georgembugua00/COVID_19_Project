# Unveiling the Link: Pre-Existing Health and COVID-19 Mortality with SQL (using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)

This project leverages the power of SQL, executed through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), to investigate the potential role of pre-existing health conditions in COVID-19 mortality disparities across countries. SSMS serves as a robust platform for data exploration and manipulation throughout this analysis.

## Project Methodology:

**Data Acquisition:** Secure high-quality datasets from reputable sources like Our World in Data (COVID-19 deaths) and public health databases (pre-existing health conditions).

**Data Wrangling:** Within SSMS, utilize SQL's robust capabilities to meticulously clean and pre-process the data, ensuring consistency and addressing missing values. Feature engineering may involve calculating death rates per capita or categorizing pre-existing health severity.

**Data Integration:** Employ SQL joins executed in SSMS to seamlessly merge the COVID-19 death data with pre-existing health data based on a common identifier (e.g., country and date).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Craft and execute SQL queries within SSMS to uncover initial trends and relationships between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 mortality rates. This may involve data visualizations to identify potential patterns.


## Expected Outcomes:

Identify statistically significant correlations between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 mortality rates.

Gain data-driven insights into how pre-existing health vulnerabilities contribute to variations in mortality across populations.

## Skillset Demonstrated:

**Data Acquisition and Management:** Ability to identify, secure, and manage high-quality datasets from diverse sources.

**Data Wrangling with SQL:** Expertise in utilizing SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering within SSMS.

**Data Integration with SQL Joins:** Proficient in merging datasets based on common identifiers using SQL joins executed in SSMS.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL:** Skilled in crafting and executing SQL queries within SSMS to uncover initial trends and relationships within data.

**Data Visualization (Implicit):** Skilled in preparing data for visualization tools to communicate insights effectively.

## Findings
The dashboard above communicates the following about the COVID-19 Pandemic.

**1.Total Deaths per Continent:**

Asia has the highest number of total deaths followed by Europe and North America.
Africa and Oceania have the lowest number of total deaths.
Total Vaccinations per Continent:

The map indicates the distribution of vaccinations across different continents. It appears that Asia has the highest total vaccinations, suggesting significant vaccination efforts in densely populated regions like China and India.
Other continents such as Europe and North America also have high vaccination numbers, whereas Africa shows lower vaccination totals.

**2.Total Cases per Continent:**

Europe has the highest total cases, followed closely by Asia.
North America also has a significant number of total cases.
Africa and Oceania have the lowest total cases, similar to the pattern observed in the total deaths.
COVID Infections Count per Continent:

The line graph shows the average highest infection count per continent over time.
Asia and Europe have experienced the highest peaks in infections, with notable increases during certain periods.
North America also shows a significant number of infections, but with a slightly different trend.
Africa and South America have lower average infection counts but still show rising trends at different points.

**Key Takeaways:**

**Impact Disparity:** There is a significant disparity in the impact of COVID-19 across different continents, with Asia, Europe, and North America being the most affected in terms of both total cases and total deaths.
Vaccination Efforts: Vaccination efforts are substantial in Asia and Europe, potentially contributing to the control of the virus in these regions.

**Trend Over Time:** The infection trends indicate waves of COVID-19, with different continents experiencing peaks at different times, highlighting the pandemic's global nature and its varied impact over time.

**Healthcare and Response:** The differences in total deaths and cases might also reflect the effectiveness of healthcare systems and response measures in different continents.
