# Analyzing COVID-19 Mortality and Pre-Existing Health with SQL and Tableau

![cover_image](https://github.com/georgembugua00/SQL-Project/assets/151632200/35c464b8-3161-4b18-9777-3de6747516f0)


This project leverages SQL through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to investigate the impact of pre-existing health conditions on COVID-19 mortality across countries.

# Project Methodology:

**Data Acquisition:**

Secure high-quality datasets from reputable sources like Our World in Data (COVID-19 deaths) and public health databases (pre-existing health conditions).
Data Wrangling:

Clean and pre-process the data using SQL in SSMS to ensure consistency and address missing values. Feature engineering may involve calculating death rates per capita or categorizing pre-existing health severity.

**Data Integration:**

Merge the COVID-19 death data with pre-existing health data using SQL joins executed in SSMS.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Execute SQL queries within SSMS to uncover trends and relationships between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 mortality rates.

# Expected Outcomes:

Identify the total COVID-19 mortality rates.
Gain insights into how pre-existing health vulnerabilities contribute to variations in mortality across populations.

# Skillset Demonstrated:

**Data Wrangling with SQL:** Expertise in utilizing SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering within SSMS.

**Data Integration with SQL Joins:** Proficient in merging datasets based on common identifiers using SQL joins executed in SSMS.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL:** Skilled in crafting and executing SQL queries within SSMS to uncover initial trends and relationships within data.

# Tableau Dashboard

## Findings

The dashboard above communicates the following about the COVID-19 Pandemic.

**1. Total Deaths per Continent:**

Asia has the highest number of total deaths, followed by Europe and North America.
Africa and Oceania have the lowest number of total deaths.

**2. Total Vaccinations per Continent:**

The map indicates the distribution of vaccinations across different continents. Asia has the highest total vaccinations, suggesting significant efforts in densely populated regions like China and India.
Europe and North America also have high vaccination numbers, whereas Africa shows lower vaccination totals.

**3. Total Cases per Continent:**

Europe has the highest total cases, followed closely by Asia.
North America also has a significant number of total cases.
Africa and Oceania have the lowest total cases, similar to the pattern observed in the total deaths.

**4. COVID Infections Count per Continent:**

The line graph shows the average highest infection count per continent over time.
Asia and Europe have experienced the highest peaks in infections, with notable increases during certain periods.
North America also shows a significant number of infections, but with a slightly different trend.
Africa and South America have lower average infection counts but still show rising trends at different points.

# Key Takeaways:

**Impact Disparity:** Significant disparity in the impact of COVID-19 across different continents, with Asia, Europe, and North America being the most affected.

**Vaccination Efforts:** Substantial vaccination efforts in Asia and Europe potentially contributing to the control of the virus in these regions.

**Trend Over Time:** The infection trends indicate waves of COVID-19, with different continents experiencing peaks at different times, highlighting the pandemic's global nature.

**Healthcare and Response:** Differences in total deaths and cases might reflect the effectiveness of healthcare systems and response measures in different continents.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and ability to leverage SSMS for data exploration. By combining skills in data acquisition, wrangling, integration, and analysis, I provide valuable insights into COVID-19 impacts, showcasing my value to any data-driven team.
