# Unveiling the Link: Pre-Existing Health and COVID-19 Mortality with SQL (using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)

This project leverages the power of SQL, executed through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), to investigate the potential role of pre-existing health conditions in COVID-19 mortality disparities across countries. SSMS serves as a robust platform for data exploration and manipulation throughout this analysis.

## Project Methodology:

**Data Acquisition:** Secure high-quality datasets from reputable sources like Our World in Data (COVID-19 deaths) and public health databases (pre-existing health conditions).

**Data Wrangling:** Within SSMS, utilize SQL's robust capabilities to meticulously clean and pre-process the data, ensuring consistency and addressing missing values. Feature engineering may involve calculating death rates per capita or categorizing pre-existing health severity.

**Data Integration:** Employ SQL joins executed in SSMS to seamlessly merge the COVID-19 death data with pre-existing health data based on a common identifier (e.g., country and date).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Craft and execute SQL queries within SSMS to uncover initial trends and relationships between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 mortality rates. This may involve data visualizations to identify potential patterns.


## Expected Outcomes:

Identify statistically significant correlations between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 mortality rates.

Gain data-driven insights into how pre-existing health vulnerabilities contribute to variations in mortality across populations.

## Skillset Demonstrated:

**Data Acquisition and Management:** Ability to identify, secure, and manage high-quality datasets from diverse sources.

**Data Wrangling with SQL:** Expertise in utilizing SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering within SSMS.

**Data Integration with SQL Joins:** Proficient in merging datasets based on common identifiers using SQL joins executed in SSMS.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL:** Skilled in crafting and executing SQL queries within SSMS to uncover initial trends and relationships within data.

**Data Visualization (Implicit):** Skilled in preparing data for visualization tools to communicate insights effectively.

This project not only showcases my technical proficiency in SQL but also your ability to leverage SSMS as a platform for data exploration and manipulation. By combining your expertise with data acquisition, wrangling, integration, and analysis, you aim to generate data-driven insights that can contribute valuable knowledge to the fight against COVID-19. 
This comprehensive approach demonstrates my value as an asset to any data-driven team.
This version uses more formal language, emphasizes my ability to leverage SSMS effectively, and highlights the broader impact of your project on public health strategies.
